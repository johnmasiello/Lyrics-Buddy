    <string name="lyrics">Mmmm, watch me\n
Hey, woo\n
One, two, three... watch me\n
\n
I woke up with all this sunlight\n
Ain\'t got time to listen to many shade, yeah\n
The wind in my pony, top-down, alright\n
Ain\'t got time to let them darken my day, that\'s right\n
\n
So light the fireworks\n
Sing like no one\'s heard\n
Dance.\n
It\'s us against the world\n
\n
Oh, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about us\n
They don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about what we do\n
Yeah, it\'s true,\n
I could have all this but I\'m good if I got you\n
Oh, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about...\n
Mmmm, listen, watch me\n
\n
You wait so long to catch that feeling\n
So hold onto it for as long as you can\n
We could run away to only where we know\n
Boy, I got plans, hey\n
\n
So light the fireworks\n
Sing like no one\'s heard\n
Dance.\n
It\'s us against the world\n
\n
Oh, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about us\n
They don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about what we do\n
Yeah, it\'s true,\n
I could have all this but I\'m good if I got you\n
Oh, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about...\n
\n
Hey\n
They don\'t know about, they don\'t know \'bout, \'bout, \'bout us\n
Light the fireworks, let it catch fire\n
We gon\' dance, dance \'til it hurts\n
When we in the clubs\n
We \'bout to let \'em know, know who\'s your girl\n
So put your hand in my hand\n
It\'s you and me, it\'s us against the world\n
Sing it to me one more time\n
It\'s you and me, it\'s us against the world\n
Sing it to me one more time\n
It\'s you and me, it\'s us against the world\n
I\'m tryna tell you, honey, it\'s us against the world\n
\n
Oh, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about us\n
They don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about what we do\n
Yeah, it\'s true,\n
I could have all this but I\'m good if I got you\n
Oh, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about...\n
\n
I woke up with all this sunlight\n
They don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about us\n
Wind in my pony, top-down, alright\n
They don\'t know, they don\'t know, they don\'t know about what we do\n
Yeah, it\'s true,\n
I could have all this but I\'m good if I got you\n
